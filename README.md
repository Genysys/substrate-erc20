# Substrate ERC20

A Parity Substrate SRML module for _single_ ERC20 token. Only one token is implemented as a runtime and is initialized using genesis config.

For multi token ERC20 runtime, check out [substrate-erc20-multi](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-erc20-multi)

**Important Note:** The Substrate framework and related libraries and APIs are rapidly under development. In case this module does not work with the latest Substrate build, please submit an issue in this repo, 
You can also try porting the runtime module into a freshly cloned `substrate-node-template` codebase.
